# Getting To Safety

I'm developing a course on _AI Safety Research_ for undergraduates. This is a record of the course development, and a repository of potential readings, examples, exercises, and paper reproductions to use in the course.

Things to look at next:

* [TIL](TIL.md): A log of things I learned, including runs of reproductions and small experiments.
* [Annotated reading list](course/reading_list.md).
* [Directory of Jupyter notebooks](notebooks/) with all exercises, experiments, and reproductions.

This is very much a work-in-progress. I anticipate running the course from September 2026.
